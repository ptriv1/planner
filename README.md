# planner

This is a planner that shows time blocks from 8 am to 5 pm.  The user can click into the time blocks and enter appointments.  Blocks are different colors depending on whether the hour is in the past, present, or future.  The appointments entered persist and when visitors return to the planner the appointments entered display in the planner.
